# Gmail Job Assistant LLM

## Overview

This repository contains a Large Language Model (LLM) assistant powered by GPT-4 mini, designed to help job seekers organize their Gmail accounts, particularly for job alerts from platforms like LinkedIn, Indeed, Untapped, and others. The project uses the Langchain framework and offers a cost-effective solution, processing over 2000 emails for less than $7.

## Features

- Email scraping from Gmail based on specific labels
- ETL process using LLM for structured data extraction
- Company information enrichment via web search
- Continuous updating and merging with historical data
- Export options to Excel or potential for LLM Q&A chatbot integration


1. Configure the repository as editable:
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```

2. Set up your .env variables:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
   gmail_credentials=/path/to/your/credentials.json
   gmail_token=/path/to/your/gmail_token.pickle
   gmail_address=yourgmailaddress@gmail.com
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key
   GOOGLE_CSE_ID=your_google_cse_id
   QUERY_GMAIL_STATE=db/gmail_query_state.json
   QUERY_COMPANY_STATE=db/company_query_state.json
   ALL_EMAILS=db/job/gmail_data/all_emails.json
   JOB_LIST=db/job/job_list_all.json
   JOB_LIST_FINAL=db/job/jobs_merge.json
   CACHE=gmail_assistant_llm/cache
   ```



## How It Works

1. **Email Scraping**: Retrieves emails from your Gmail account based on specified labels.
2. **ETL Process**: 
   - Extracts structured JSON data from raw email objects
   - LLM assists in parsing position information, company names, dates, etc.
3. **Company Research**: 
   - LLM searches the web for additional company details
   - Gathers info on founding year, IPO status, funding, industry, etc.
4. **Data Integration**: Automatically merges new data with historical database

This process helps job seekers prioritize applications based on their interests and company profiles, saving time on manual research. ðŸ˜…
